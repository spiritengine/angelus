# Angelus

Scheduling and notification spine for autonomous agent work. Part of the spiritengine ecosystem (alongside spindle, mill, shuttle, skein, horizon, scry).

## Why this exists

Agent infrastructure today (spindle, mill, horizon) handles delegation and orchestration on demand. There's no reliable layer for **scheduled** autonomous work, **consolidated** routine reporting, or **escalated** urgent findings. Manual checks miss things; one-off scripts don't notice changes.

The activating example: iotaschool.com went down sometime before 2026-05-11 and was only caught by a manual run of a dead-link audit script. Angelus must catch the up→down transition within the cadence of whatever pipe alerts urgently.

Three independent reliability layers (belt, suspenders, boots) so the system itself can't silently stop watching.

## The frame

Pipeline shape:

    source → observation → triage → finding → pipe → channel → dispatch

- **Source** — anything that produces observations (cron, inbox, watch, webhook, manual).
- **Check** — the body a time-based source runs.
- **Observation** — a raw item in the pipeline, pre-classification.
- **Triage / Triager** — classification stage and the script/chain/mantle doing it.
- **Finding** — a triaged item with routing metadata.
- **Pipe** — a named aggregation tier with cadence + policy + channel(s) (e.g. `now`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`).
- **Channel** — an output sink (push, email, skein, etc.).
- **Dispatch** — one send action.
- **Dependencies** — things angelus rests on; their failure is also angelus's failure.
- **Belfry** — runs **health checks** to external sinks so angelus-dying is alerted independently.

## Design

Canonical spec: skein folio `brief-20260513-b1a3`.

Implementation roadmap (master + slice briefs): `brief-20260513-yctm`. Start here when picking up implementation.

M2 adversarial-test plan: `brief-20260513-cz9x`.

## Status

Slice 1 implements the first load-bearing vertical path: scheduled shell source,
observation storage, pull-based triage, finding and incident lifecycle, the `now`
pipe, and the `push` channel.

## Install

```sh
pip install -e .
```

## Run

```sh
angelus --help
angelus daemon
```

Set `ANGELUS_DRY_RUN=1` to write push payloads to `dispatches.log` instead of
calling `notify-pat`.

## Reliability

### Transport separation

Urgent and routine alerts ride different transports, so a dead transport can't
swallow the alerts that matter most. The routine digest pipe (`daily`) uses
email; the urgent/immediate pipe (`now`) and any escalation path use push
(`notify-pat`). Don't point the `now` pipe — or any future escalation pipe — at
the same channel as the digest. The 2026-05-29 incident was exactly this failure
mode: email silently broke and the alerts that would have surfaced it were also
riding email.

The belfry is the external reliability layer. It runs outside the daemon from
raw cron, checks `state/angelus.pid`, reads `source_fires` from
`state/angelus.sqlite3` in read-only mode, pings healthchecks.io, and calls
`notify-pat` directly when the daemon is dead or wedged.

Setup:

1. Register two healthchecks.io URLs as described in `belfry/healthchecks.example`.
2. Export `ANGELUS_BELFRY_SUCCESS_URL` and `ANGELUS_BELFRY_DOWN_URL` for cron.
3. Paste the entry from `belfry/crontab.example`.

The default wedge threshold is 10 minutes. Override it with
`ANGELUS_BELFRY_WEDGE_THRESHOLD_SEC` if your source cadence needs more slack.

Optional boots layer: keep it advisory. The canonical watchdog lives in
`deploy/boots-watchdog.sh` and watches the same belfry sentinel file
(`state/belfry-pinged-at` by default, or `ANGELUS_BELFRY_SENTINEL_PATH` if
overridden). Install it from system cron or systemd, for example:

`*/10 * * * * ANGELUS_ROOT=/opt/angelus ANGELUS_BOOTS_NOTIFY='mail -s "angelus boots alert" you@example.com' /opt/angelus/deploy/boots-watchdog.sh`

The script alerts when the sentinel is missing or older than
`ANGELUS_BOOTS_STALE_MINUTES` (default `30`). It does not add a lodged
dependency check or any new angelus product behavior; the operator owns the
outermost watchdog wiring.

## Storage

SQLite is the authoritative lifecycle store. Migrations live in `migrations/` as ordered SQL files named `<NNNN>_<name>.sql`. The storage initializer enables WAL mode and applies pending migrations in order, with each migration and its `schema_migrations` bookkeeping recorded atomically.

The initial migration creates the v3.1 tables:

- `source_fires`
- `observations`
- `findings`
- `incidents`
- `triager_state`
- `pipe_queues`
- `dispatches`
- `dep_health`
- `schedule_registry`
- `backoff_store`

`observations` and `findings` both include a `status` column for the later `writing` to `ready` write-order protocol.

Subsequent migrations add:

- `observation_triage` — per-(observation, triager) lifecycle for the pull triage loop (status, last_error). Migration 0002; migration 0003 adds `attempt` and `next_attempt_at` for retry scheduling.
- `channel_health` — per-channel healthy/unhealthy status with the most recent failure; the threshold ladder in the pipe runner flips it. Migration 0003 (which also adds `next_attempt_at` to `pipe_queues` and the retry columns to `observation_triage`).
- `pipe_state` — last successful drain time per pipe, used by the daily/digest cadence. Migration 0004 (also adds a CHECKed `status` to `pipe_queues` and a `source` column to `dispatches`; `next_attempt_at` was added earlier by migration 0003).
- `mutes` — per-dedup_key suppression with an expiry and optional comment; consulted on dispatch. Migration 0005 (also adds `close_comment` to `incidents`).
- `dep_health` is dropped and recreated by migration 0006 with the slice-5c dependency-registry shape (`dependency_name` PK, status CHECK, `last_check_at` and `updated_at` NOT NULL, nullable `detail`).
- `digest_channel_attempts` — per-(pipe, channel) digest send-attempt counter so the digest path can consume the same channel_health threshold ladder the immediate path uses without inflating it by the per-cycle batch size. Daemon-restart-scoped (cleared at startup) to match `channel_health`. Migration 0007.
